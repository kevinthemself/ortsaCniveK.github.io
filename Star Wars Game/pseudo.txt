what do you see on the page:

characters available for play (4) -- clicking toggles this as player character
"Your Character"

break (before choosing char, then filled in with the other options)
"Enemies available to attack"
	this is where player chooses enemy

"Fight Section"
Attack Button

"Defender"
Shows current enemy being fought

Pseudo Code:

Each character should have Health Points, Attack Power, Counter Attack Power attributes
	Attack power should have a function that increases its attack power every time an attack is made (ex 6, 12, 18, 24, 30...)

		attack () {
			enemy.healthPoints -= current;
			//deals dmg equal to the current attack

			current += 6
			//change the value of the current attack by whatever the base is, var should be def outside this function.

			this.healthPoints -= enemy.counterAttack
			//implements the counter attack immediately, and leaves unchanged
		}

	Counter attack power should stay consistent
		SHOULD BE CONST

	each of these attributes should be different for each character

	no char can heal health

	no reset in health between fights

	each character should have a way of winning (should be an unspecified path the player has to figure out)

add css to make it FANCY
