				<p>
					My name is Kevin Castro.  I am an aspiring Web Developer, taking part in the Coding Bootcamp offered by the UCSD Coding Bootcamp.  I am a current student at San Diego Mesa College.  I am studying Computer Science and Math as a double major.  I am interested in working in cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, computer-to-human interfaces and Neural Networks after delving more into understanding the internet as a whole, since I think that distributed computing and the like will allow for these things to be researched further.
				</p>

				<p>
					Like I mentioned above, I am a college student, who likes to spend time learning anything about everything.  I like to think of myself as a Jack of All Trades, Master of Some, since I spend a lot of my time learning new topics and becoming an expert on the things that I have an extremely vested interest in.  Outside of trying to learn new things, I spend my downtime playing video games, practicing playing my guiar, folding Origami, and trying to do some voice acting on the side.  I love meeting new people and learning about other people's walks of life.  I think it is important for an individual to understand as many different perspectives as possible.
