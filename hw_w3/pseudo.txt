Hangman modules and pseudo code

on landing page (index should be all that is necessary)
	game should show current information -- at start, it should show basic game info, such as:
		Press any key to get started
		Wins (current)
		Current word ()
		Number of Guesses Remaining
		Letters already guessed.

//--------------------GAME ITSELF--------------------//

must be saved as an object
	functions the game does should be saved as methods

	!!-----Remember-----!!
		global vars and methods above the object
			globals, then objects, then calls.

use key events to listen for the letters that users type

Should have some repository of words that are valid for using in Hangman
	when building, display word at the start, then set empty string with underscores using for loop for number of letter in the word
		may need function in order to space the word properly, would be spaces between each letter on output, (one less than the length) no change to the array is needed.

May need a hint picture? no -- picture should be from last game played
	maybe set to post-first game blurb about the picture itself

remember to store the letters already guessed, and add function to check to see if the user already guessed -- if so, guess number should remain unchanged.

should have const set to current games won

should have a game over screen

should have some way of displaying exactly what the current word is, and displaying should break spacing once the correct letter is chosen
	may need to have .contains() function

Display is an underscore until the correct letter is displayed
	save as two separate arrays to assure that the word is not displayed

Once a win is achieved, increase the win counter by one and display
	Additionally, may need to update with some new image as a hint?  Or perhaps the last word won -- double check the video
	When the user wins, play a sound or some other confirmation that indicates a win has been achieved.

Overall should be a pretty basic game, styling on top should be created after the game is up and running :)
