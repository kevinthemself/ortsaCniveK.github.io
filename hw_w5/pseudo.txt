	This is the Stranger Things font

create generalized timer, times should vary for each question, could be based on character length?

might need to create a div with general congratulations screen, or maybe even an extra page with a redirect back and forth
	may need to leave it empty to start, then the congratulations screen would display the right answer, start a 5-second timer, then switch back

when time interval runs out, give an alert that they are out of time and display the correct answer
		if using bootstrap, could change the state of the answer entry/custom css with an outline around the correct answer

keep count of correct and wrong answers

	option for restarting the game should NOT refresh the page -- maybe just have it so it clears all the answers and restarts
